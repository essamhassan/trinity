# Trinity
A playground for financial pattern recognition experiments. This is only a fun project and it's not by any mean made for actual trading ( also code is the `written on the commute` level)


## Future?
- play with reversed percent change
- try to optimize performance. there are definitely too many better ways of doing this ( yeah it's terrible and I know it  )
- implement a RNN because why not?
- implement a simulator
- custom parser for files
- separating logic into modules for ( plotting, pattern storage, pattern search, simulation and back testing )
