# Trinity
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/essamhassan/trinity/master/assets/splash.png)

A playground for financial pattern recognition experiments. This is only a fun project and it's not by any mean made for actual trading ( also code is the `written on the commute` level)


## Future?
- play with reversed percent change
- try to optimize performance. there are definitely too many better ways of doing this.
- implement a RNN because why not?
- implement a simulator
- custom parser for files
- separating logic into modules for ( plotting, pattern storage, pattern search, simulation and back testing )
